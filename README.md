# Rangefinder
The goal is to create a system that uses two wide angle cameras to determine an objectâ€™s location in space, and then to use that information to guide a turret to point a laser at it. This project can be further developed to identify objects such as drones or RC aircraft to act as an area denial tool, if the laser is changed to something more damaging
