**Build Guide:**

Laser Cut Acrylic Panels

Cut aluminum beams to the proper length, with 4 being 400mm, 4 being 200mm, and 4 being 100mm

Secure arduino and glue breadboard to bottom acrylic panel (Arduino uses M3 screws)

Secure gimbal mount to top acrylic panel with M4 screws

Secure cameras to side acrylic panels with M3 screws

Screw side and bottom acrylic panels to respective aluminium beams with M5 screws

Secure top acrylic panel to bottom panel using standoffs and M4 screws

Connect side panels with bottom panel using 400mm beams and 90 degree mounts

Connect 5v and GND pins on arduino to VCC and GND rails on breadboard

Connect laser to VCC and GND breadboard rails

Connect + and - of the two servos to VCC and GND breadboard rails

Connect X servo data to pin 10 of arduino
