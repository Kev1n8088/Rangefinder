**Summary**

This project was definitely one of the more technically challenging projects that I have ever done. The Kerbal Controller project was also very hard, however its difficulty mainly came from the scale of the project, not the actual complexity. The rangefinder project has challenged my skills, not just in computer science, but also in mathematics and trigonometry. Right now all itâ€™s doing is marking a color with a laser pointer, but I believe with some further development it could be able to identify specific objects and enact actions against the objects, such as taking photos with a high-definition camera, projecting an image, or shooting a weapon. The potential for this sort of system would be incredibly broad, ranging from industrial to military. I will certainly be doing more research on this project in the future.
